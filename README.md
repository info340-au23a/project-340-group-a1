# INFO 340 Project - Fantasy Football App

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

Names: Tom Jubin, Anshul Karanam, Trevor Wong, Christopher Chen

The repository for this app is designed to replicate a fantasy football experience by providing in-depth analysis, real-time team updates of players, and user-friendly management tools. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to fantasy football, our app is tailored to help you make informed decisions and stay ahead in your league. Although the data was static across pages, we envisioned with more players and users utilizing the web app that it would be able to provide a platform to play fantasy football with friends.

We used react library: Material UI -- which can be installed with:
```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

The Main Features of our app consist of:

# Mobile and Desktop Compatibility
    Seamless experience across all devices.
    Sync your data in real-time between your phone, tablet, and computer.

# Player Analytics 
    In-depth player stats

# Live Score Updates
    View player performance stats as they happen.

# Dashboard
    Custom dashboard to track your league standings, team performance (*some components may be static)
